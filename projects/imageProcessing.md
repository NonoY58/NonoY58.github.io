# Image Processing

What to develop is under consideration. The purpose of this project is to obtain basic workflow of Image Processing using Python.  

### Basics
- [How to Publish an Open-Source Python Package to PyPI](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/)
  - PyPI; Python Package Index is a repository containing several hundred thousand packages.  
- [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
  - create venv
    - "python -m venv (env_name)"
  - activate venv
    - move to the directory.
    - "(env_name)/Scripts/activate"
  - deactivate venv
    - type "deactivate"
  - delete venv
    - simply delete folder by typing "rm -r venv"  
  - [[vidio] Creating a Virtual Environment](https://realpython.com/lessons/creating-virtual-environment/#transcript)  
  
- [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
    - How to handle classes and instances.
      - **class**  is like a blueprint for creating an object.
      - **instance** is an object that is built from a class and contains real data.
    - [Python Class Constructors: Control Your Object Instantiation](https://realpython.com/python-class-constructor/)
    - [Python Command Line Arguments](https://realpython.com/python-command-line-arguments/)
- [Python String Formatting Best Practices](https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/)
  - "f{ }" => f-strings, a.k.a formatted string literals.
  - [Python 3's f-Strings: An Improved String Formatting Syntax (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)
- [Difference Between Python Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Frameworks](https://learnpython.com/blog/python-modules-packages-libraries-frameworks/)
  -  **A module** is basically a bunch of related code saved in a file with the extension .py.
  - **Python packages** are basically a directory of a collection of **modules**.
  - **A library** is an umbrella term referring to a reusable chunk of code. However, it is often assumed that while **a package** is a collection of **modules**, a **library** is a collection of **packages**.

### GUI

- [Python and PyQt: Building a GUI Desktop Calculator](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/)
  - Built PyQt6 environment through this instruction.
  -  


- [PyQt vs PySide Licensing](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/pyqt-vs-pyside/)  
  - A GPL lisence allow users to distribute software if the source code is also distributed.
