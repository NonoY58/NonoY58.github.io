# Image Processing

Create a desktop app using PyQt to modify an image to obtain basic workflow of Image Processing with Python.  


### Basics
- [Python Virtual Environments: A Primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
  - create venv
    - "python -m venv (env_name)"
  - activate venv
    - move to the directory.
    - "(env_name)/Scripts/activate"
  - deactivate venv
    - type "deactivate"
  - delete venv
    - simply delete folder by typing "rm -r venv"

      - **class**  is like a blueprint for creating an object.
      - **instance** is an object that is built from a class and contains real data.

  - "f{ }" => f-strings, a.k.a formatted string literals.

- [Difference Between Python Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Frameworks](https://learnpython.com/blog/python-modules-packages-libraries-frameworks/)
  -  **A module** is basically a bunch of related code saved in a file with the extension .py.
  - **Python packages** are basically a directory of a collection of **modules**.
  - **A library** is an umbrella term referring to a reusable chunk of code. However, it is often assumed that while **a package** is a collection of **modules**, a **library** is a collection of **packages**.
