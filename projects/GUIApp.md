# Desktop App
Here I show you some of my GUI apps using PyQt6.


### Image Manupilation
The following is GUI of "Image Manupilation" app.
<img src="images\ImageProcessingToolfigure1_v3.jpg" width="600">  

You can change color features of an image, also rotate it, resize it, and more.

You can crop the image by specifying location of the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner with left and right click, respectively. After pushing the 'SAVE' button, the image will be saved in j-peg format with a parameter-list file in JSON format.

Anyway, you can use the app by following the procedure below.
>  1. Execute a file named `ImageProcessingTool_QGraph.py` in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/NonoY58/Image-Processing-Tool). 
>  2. Click the `OPEN` button at the bottom.
>  3. After selecting an image you want to manupilate, another window for viewing image will emerge.
>  4. Manupilate the image with paremeters as you want.
>  5. Select the top-left corner with left click, also right click for the bottom-right corner.
>  6. Specify the resize factor.
>  7. Lastly, push the `SAVE` button.(This will create both an image file and a setting file in the `processed_images` folder.)
>  8. You can load setting by pushing the `LOAD` button. After that, you can go back to initial state and loaded state by clicking the `->Loaded` button and the `->initial` button.

That's all! I hope you enjoy it.
